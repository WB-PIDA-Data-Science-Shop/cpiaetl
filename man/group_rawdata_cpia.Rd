\title{Grouped Raw CPIA Indicator Data by Region and Income Group}
\format{
A tibble with aggregated raw indicator values and 78+ variables:
\describe{
\item{group}{Character. The name of the region or income group.}
\item{year}{Integer. Reference year for the indicators.}
\item{...}{Remaining columns contain average raw indicator values for various governance
measures from V-Dem, WGI, AII, CLIAR, PEFA, and other sources. Each numeric column
represents the mean value of that indicator across all countries in the group.}
\item{group_type}{Character. Indicates whether the group represents an "Income Group"
or "Region" classification.}
}
}
\source{
Derived from raw governance indicator data compiled by the World Bank Governance
Global Practice. See \code{metadata_cpia} for indicator-specific sources.
}
\usage{
group_rawdata_cpia
}
\description{
A dataset containing average raw governance indicator values aggregated by World Bank
region and income group. This dataset provides regional and income-level benchmarks
for the underlying indicators used to construct CPIA scores, enabling analysis of
specific governance dimensions before transformation to the CPIA scale.
}
\details{
This dataset aggregates raw indicator values from \code{rawcpia_tbl} (the clean numeric
version without the header row) by calculating means within regions and income groups.
It provides:

**Indicator-Level Benchmarks:**
Compare specific governance dimensions (e.g., judicial independence, budget transparency,
corruption control) across regions and income levels using original indicator scales.

**Pre-Transformation Analysis:**
Examine raw indicator patterns before they are normalized and transformed to CPIA scores,
useful for understanding the underlying data distributions.

**Methodological Flexibility:**
Apply custom aggregation methods, weighting schemes, or transformations to raw indicators
for specialized governance analyses.

Each indicator retains its original scale and interpretation. Indicators are averaged
with \code{na.rm = TRUE}, so groups with more countries or better indicator coverage
will have more reliable averages.
