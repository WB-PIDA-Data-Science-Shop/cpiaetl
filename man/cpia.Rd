\description{
A dataset containing CPIA-related governance indicators by country and year.
The data integrates country-level CPIA sub-criteria (questions 12, 15, and 16)
derived from the CPIA framework and associated static indicators used to
generate comparable scores across countries.
}
\details{
The CPIA dataset supports the generation of governance scores under the
World Bank’s Country Policy and Institutional Assessment framework. It combines
country-level and regional aggregates with derived indicator scores for the
Governance cluster (Questions 12, 15, and 16). Missing values (\code{NaN})
indicate unavailable data or country-years not assessed.
