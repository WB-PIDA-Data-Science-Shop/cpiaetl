\title{CPIA Question 13b Indicator: Government Spending as Share of Budget}
\format{
A tibble with 2,368 rows and 4 variables:
\describe{
  \item{country_code}{A three-letter ISO country code.}
  \item{year}{The reference year for the observation (as character).}
  \item{q13b_raw}{The raw value of the variable}
  \item{q13b}{The transformed indicator representing the estimated CPIA 13b score
              (numeric, ranging approximately from 1 to 6).}
}
}
\source{
Constructed by the author using government spending as a share of
the approved budget, transformed to approximate the CPIA 13b methodology.

\usage{
q13b_tbl
}
\description{
This dataset provides an empirical proxy for CPIA Question 13b, which assesses
the credibility of the government budget — specifically, the extent to which
actual government expenditures align with the approved budget. The indicator
is constructed using data on government spending as a share of the approved
budget, transformed to align with the 1–6 scale of the World Bank’s Country
Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) framework.
}
\details{
The transformation follows these steps:
\enumerate{
  \item Compute the deviation of government spending from 100\% of the approved budget
        to capture the distance from perfect budget execution.
  \item Reverse the direction of the indicator so that higher values represent
        greater credibility (i.e., spending closer to 100\% of the budget).
  \item Rescale the indicator to lie between 0 and 1.
  \item Translate the rescaled indicator to the CPIA scale of 1 to 6 using
        the transformation \eqn{y = 5x + 1}.
}

The resulting indicator can be interpreted as an approximation of the CPIA
13b score, where higher values indicate greater budget credibility and stronger
alignment between planned and executed government expenditures.
