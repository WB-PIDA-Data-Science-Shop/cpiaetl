  \item{country_code}{Character. Three-letter ISO3 country code.}
  \item{year}{Integer. Year of observation.}
  \item{wb_wdi_rq_per_rnk}{Numeric. \strong{Index of Regulatory Quality} — captures perceptions of the ability of the government

  Theoretical range: \code{c(0, 100)}. (Corresponds to CPIA question 12b).}
  \item{wb_wdi_cc_est}{Numeric. \strong{Control of Corruption Index} — captures perceptions of the extent to which public power
  is exercised for private gain, including both petty and grand forms of corruption, as well as state capture by elites
  and private interests. Theoretical range: \code{c(-2.5, 2.5)}. (Corresponds to CPIA question 16c).}
  \item{wb_wdi_va_est}{Numeric. \strong{Voice and Accountability Index} — captures perceptions of the extent to which a country's

\description{
The `wdi_tbl` dataset contains governance indicator data from the *World Governance Indicators (WGI)* project,
published by the World Bank. The data provides standardized measures of regulatory quality, control of corruption,
and voice and accountability across countries and years. These indicators are widely used in governance diagnostics
and complement the CPIA governance cluster dimensions.
}
\details{
The World Governance Indicators (WGI) are compiled by the World Bank and represent composite indices based on
multiple underlying data sources. They are standardized annually, allowing cross-country comparisons in governance
performance and trends over time. Higher values denote better governance performance on the respective dimension.

This dataset is part of the proxy data assembled for the CPIA governance cluster and covers all available countries
and years from the WGI database used in the CPIA data harmonization exercise.
