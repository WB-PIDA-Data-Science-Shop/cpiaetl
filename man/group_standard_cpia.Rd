\title{Grouped Standard CPIA by Region and Income Group}
\format{
A tibble with aggregated CPIA scores and 16 variables:
\describe{

and Southern", "Low income", "High income").}
\item{year}{Integer. Original year of the underlying indicator data.}
\item{q12a}{Numeric. Average CPIA criterion 12a score for the group (1-6 scale).}
\item{q12b}{Numeric. Average CPIA criterion 12b score for the group (1-6 scale).}
\item{q12c}{Numeric. Average CPIA criterion 12c score for the group (1-6 scale).}
\item{q13b}{Numeric. Average CPIA criterion 13b score for the group (1-6 scale).}
\item{q15a}{Numeric. Average CPIA criterion 15a score for the group (1-6 scale).}
\item{q15b}{Numeric. Average CPIA criterion 15b score for the group (1-6 scale).}
\item{q15c}{Numeric. Average CPIA criterion 15c score for the group (1-6 scale).}
\item{q16a}{Numeric. Average CPIA criterion 16a score for the group (1-6 scale).}
\item{q16b}{Numeric. Average CPIA criterion 16b score for the group (1-6 scale).}
\item{q16c}{Numeric. Average CPIA criterion 16c score for the group (1-6 scale).}
\item{q16d}{Numeric. Average CPIA criterion 16d score for the group (1-6 scale).}
\item{cpia_year}{Integer. Reference year for the CPIA assessment (year + 1).}
\item{group_type}{Character. Indicates whether the group represents an "Income Group"
or "Region" classification.}

\description{
A dataset containing average Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA)
scores aggregated by World Bank region and income group. This dataset provides
regional and income-level benchmarks for governance performance using standard
CPIA indicators (excluding African Integrity Indicators).
}
\details{
This dataset aggregates country-level CPIA scores from \code{standard_cpia} by calculating
mean scores for each CPIA criterion within regions and income groups. It enables:

**Regional Comparisons:**
Compare governance performance across World Bank regions (Africa Eastern and Southern,
Africa Western and Central, East Asia & Pacific, etc.).

**Income Group Benchmarking:**
Analyze how governance quality varies by income level (Low income, Lower middle income,
Upper middle income, High income).

**Trend Analysis:**
Track changes in regional and income group governance performance over time.

The aggregation uses simple means with \code{na.rm = TRUE}, so groups with more
countries or better data coverage may have more reliable averages. Missing values
(\code{NaN}) indicate that no countries in that group had data for that criterion
in that year.
