\title{CPIA Indicator Metadata}
\format{
A tibble with 80 rows and 7 variables:
\describe{
\item{indicator}{Character. The unique indicator code used in the raw data
(e.g., \code{"vdem_core_v2clacjstm"}, \code{"wb_wdi_cc_est"}, \code{"gi_aii_10"}).}
\item{variable}{Character. CPIA variable code indicating which CPIA question/criterion
the indicator maps to (e.g., \code{"q12a"}, \code{"q15b"}, \code{"q16c"}).}
\item{source}{Character. The primary data source or project providing the indicator:
\itemize{
  \item CLIAR - Closeness to Frontier indicators
  \item African Integrity Index - Global Integrity AII project
  \item World Governance Indicators - World Bank WGI
  \item V-Dem - Varieties of Democracy project
  \item PEFA - Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability
  \item Heritage Index of Economic Freedom
  \item World Justice Project
  \item World Development Indicators
}}
\item{var_name}{Character. Human-readable short label for the indicator
(e.g., "Control of Corruption", "Judicial Independence", "Budget Transparency").}
\item{var_description}{Character. Detailed description of what the indicator measures,
including methodology, coverage, and interpretation. This field contains the full
technical definition from the source documentation.}
\item{var_description_short}{Character. Concise one-sentence summary of the indicator
suitable for dashboards, charts, and reports.}
\item{theoretical_range}{Character. The theoretical minimum and maximum values for the
indicator in its original scale, expressed as R code (e.g., \code{"c(0,1)"},
\code{"c(-2.5, 2.5)"}, \code{"c(0, 100)"}).}
}
}
\source{
Compiled by the World Bank Governance Global Practice from source documentation
of V-Dem, WGI, AII, CLIAR, PEFA, and other governance data projects.

\description{
A comprehensive metadata dataset documenting all indicators used in the construction
of CPIA governance cluster scores. Each row describes one indicator, including its
source, definition, theoretical range, and mapping to CPIA questions. This dataset
is essential for understanding CPIA score composition and ensuring methodological
transparency.
}
\details{
This metadata dataset provides complete documentation for the 80 indicators used in
CPIA score construction. It enables:

**Transparency:**
- Full disclosure of all data sources and indicator definitions
- Clear mapping from indicators to CPIA questions
- Documentation of indicator scales and ranges

**Reproducibility:**
- Enables replication of CPIA score calculations
- Supports verification and validation of methodology
- Facilitates sensitivity analyses

**Research:**
- Understand which governance dimensions are captured by each CPIA criterion
- Compare measurement approaches across data sources
- Identify gaps or overlaps in indicator coverage

Multiple indicators can map to the same CPIA variable code, reflecting the use of
multiple data sources to measure similar governance dimensions. These are averaged
in the final CPIA score calculation.
