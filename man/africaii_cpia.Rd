\description{
A comprehensive dataset containing Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA)
scores for the governance cluster (Questions 12, 13, 15, and 16) calculated using
global governance indicators supplemented with African Integrity Indicators (AII)
where available. This version provides enhanced coverage and granularity for African
countries by incorporating AII governance metrics.
}
\details{
This dataset augments standard governance indicators with data from the African Integrity
Indicators (AII) project compiled by Global Integrity and includes World Bank country
classification metadata (region, income group, lending category). The AII provides detailed
assessments of governance, transparency, accountability, and anti-corruption mechanisms
specifically for African countries, offering more nuanced measurements than global
indicators alone.

**Methodology:**
The scoring methodology is identical to \code{standard_cpia}, but includes AII indicators
in the aggregation process. When both global and AII indicators are available for the
same CPIA criterion, they are averaged together. This provides more robust estimates
for African countries while maintaining comparability with other regions.

**Coverage:**
AII data is available for select African countries covering 2014-2018. For countries
and years without AII data, this dataset falls back to the same indicators used in
\code{standard_cpia}.
