\description{
A comprehensive dataset containing Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA)
scores for the governance cluster (Questions 12, 13, 15, and 16) calculated using
standard global governance indicators, excluding the African Integrity Indicators.
This dataset provides objective, data-driven proxy scores for CPIA criteria based
on indicators from V-Dem, World Governance Indicators, CLIAR, PEFA, and other
internationally recognized sources.
}
\details{
The World Bank's CPIA is an annual assessment of the quality of countries' policy and
institutional frameworks. This dataset provides objective proxy scores for the governance
cluster using quantitative indicators from multiple international data sources.

**Methodology:**
Indicators from various sources (V-Dem, WGI, CLIAR, etc.) are mapped to specific CPIA
questions, normalized to 0-1 scale, and then transformed to the CPIA 1-6 scale using
the formula: CPIA_score = (normalized_value × 5) + 1. When multiple indicators map to
the same CPIA criterion, their scores are averaged.

**Data Sources:**
This standard version uses governance indicators from V-Dem, World Governance Indicators,
CLIAR Closeness-to-Frontier metrics, PEFA assessments, and World Development Indicators,
but excludes African Integrity Indicators to maintain global consistency.

Missing values indicate either unavailable underlying data or that a country was not
assessed for that criterion in that year.
