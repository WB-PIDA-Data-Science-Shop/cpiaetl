\description{
A dataset containing the World Bank's official country classifications including
economy names, country codes, income groups, lending categories, and regional
assignments. This dataset uses the World Bank's updated regional classification
that splits Sub-Saharan Africa into Eastern/Southern and Western/Central regions.
}
\details{
This dataset reflects the World Bank's current operational classification of countries
and territories. The regional classification follows the World Bank's updated structure
that divides Sub-Saharan Africa into two regions: Africa Eastern and Southern (AFE)
and Africa Western and Central (AFW). This provides more granular regional analysis
for governance and development indicators.

The lending categories reflect eligibility for different World Bank financing instruments:
\itemize{
  \item IDA countries are eligible for concessional financing
  \item IBRD countries can borrow at market-based terms
  \item Blend countries are eligible for both IDA and IBRD financing
  \item High-income countries typically have \code{NA} for lending category
}
}
